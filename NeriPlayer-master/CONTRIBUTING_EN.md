## Contributing to NeriPlayer

Thank you for contributing to NeriPlayer.
This document describes the **current Android client and Listen Together Worker
implementation**. Keep documentation aligned with the source code and runtime behavior.

---

### Scope

- NeriPlayer is a **native Android audio player**, not a public cloud music service.
- Online source capabilities mainly come from **NetEase Cloud Music**,
  **Bilibili**, and **YouTube Music**.
- Playback metadata and lyrics completion currently use **NetEase + QQ Music**,
  with LRCLIB available as an external lyrics source.
- Data is local by default. GitHub / WebDAV sync is **optional** and syncs
  metadata such as playlists, favorites, recent plays, and playback stats,
  not media files.
- The Listen Together server lives in `np-submodule/NeriPlayer-LTW` and is based
  on Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects.

---

### Documentation Map

When maintaining docs, split them by audience:

- `README.md` / `README_EN.md`
  - For users and new contributors: project scope, feature boundaries,
    installation/builds, sync, and privacy.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` / `CONTRIBUTING_EN.md`
  - For developers: module boundaries, extension paths, tests, and PR expectations.
- `app/src/main/cpp/README.md`
  - Defines the alternative-license scope for NeriPlayer-owned native source,
    third-party exclusions, and the explicit dual-license statement required
    for external contributions to enter that scope.
- `app/src/main/cpp/tests/usb/config/host-gate-contract.md`
  - Defines the public native USB host gate, CI coverage, and real-device boundary.
- `app/src/main/cpp/tests/usb/corpus/README.md` and
  `app/src/main/cpp/tests/usb/fixtures/README.md`
  - Define the synthetic/auditable boundary for public USB test corpus and fixtures;
    device-derived evidence stays in the private evidence tree.
- `np-submodule/NeriPlayer-LTW/README.md`
  - For Listen Together server deployers: Worker API, event model, deployment,
    and local checks.

If a behavior change affects user understanding, update the README.
If it affects extension paths, tests, or module boundaries, update CONTRIBUTING.

---

### Development Environment

- **Android Studio**: latest stable version
- **JDK**: 17
- **Kotlin**: 2.4.10, JVM target 17
- **AGP**: 9.2.1
- **Gradle**: 9.4.1
- **compileSdk / targetSdk / minSdk**: 37 / 36 / 28
- **NDK**: `27.0.12077973`
- **CMake**: `3.28.0+`
- **Node.js**: 20, for Listen Together Worker checks
- **Version name format**: `<git_short_hash>.<MMddHHmm>`
- **Release APK filename**: `NeriPlayer-<versionName>[-abi].apk`

Additional notes:

- The repository uses Git submodules. Clone with `--recursive`, or run
  `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
- The build script reads the Git short commit hash to generate the version name,
  so Git must be installed locally.
- Dependency versions are managed by `gradle/libs.versions.toml` and module
  `build.gradle.kts` files.
- Only `zh` and `en` resources are kept in the app, via the locale filter in `build-logic`.

### Quality Guardrails

NeriPlayer covers a broad product surface. Protect these paths first:

- **Playback**: `PlayerManager`, stream resolution, cache, URL refresh,
  auto source switching, long-form progress memory, BilibiliSponsorBlock skip
  policy, state recovery, loudness normalization, channel balance, high-resolution
  output, the USB-exclusive native path, startup watchdogs, and foreground/background
  health audits.
- **Downloads**: `AudioDownloadManager`, `GlobalDownloadManager`,
  `DownloadTaskStore`, `DownloadLifecyclePolicies`, `ManagedDownloadStorage`,
  resume checkpoints, sidecar files, queue recovery, cancellation cleanup, and SAF migration.
- **Sync**: GitHub / WebDAV three-way merge, deletion records, playback stats,
  missing-field snapshot cleanup, JSON/ProtoBuf/Base64 compatibility, and WebDAV
  concurrency protection.
- **Local data**: atomic playlist JSON writes, local metadata hydration,
  config import/export, encrypted auth storage, and DataStore settings.
- **Lyrics and Now Playing UI**: `AdvancedLyricsView`, `SyncedLyricsView`,
  `LyricShareSheet`, phonetic lyric display, long-press lyric sharing, and the
  full-screen Lyrics page.
- **Navigation and glass UI**: `MainTabLayerHost`, drawer/coherent detail feedback,
  interruptible main-tab switching, page-state retention, and Advanced Glass
  owner handoff.
- **Storage and cache UI**: `StorageUsageAnalyzer`, cache cleanup options,
  download directory indexes, and SAF snapshots.
- **Listen Together**: Android client, Worker protocol fields, roles, queues,
  version-gated updates, stream-link sharing toggles, and controller-offline recovery.
- **Diagnostics**: safe mode, JVM/native crash logs, ANR capture, and Debug probes.
- **Local persistence**: debounced playback/traffic-stat writes, lifecycle flushes,
  atomic file replacement, and local-playlist/SAF initialization readiness.

Related tests live under `app/src/test/` and `app/src/androidTest/`.
When changing these areas, search for neighboring tests first, then add coverage
for the new behavior.

---

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/cwuom/NeriPlayer.git
   cd NeriPlayer
   ```
2. Build the Debug APK:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
   ```
3. Install it onto a device:
   ```bash
   adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```
4. First launch enters the disclaimer and startup onboarding flow. Android 13+
   devices request notification permission.
5. For debugging access, tap the **version number** 7 times in Settings. A
   standalone `Debug` tab will appear in the bottom navigation bar.

---

### Release Build

Release builds enable minification and resource shrinking by default.
A normal `assembleRelease` builds `arm64-v8a` only. Multi-ABI output requires an
extra Gradle property.

1. Provide signing config in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`, project Gradle
   properties, or through command-line `-P` properties:
   ```properties
   KEYSTORE_FILE=/absolute/path/to/neri.jks
   KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=your_store_password
   KEY_ALIAS=key0
   KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password
   ```

   If `KEYSTORE_FILE` is relative, it is resolved against the `app/` module
   directory. The current Release build does **not** fall back to the debug
   signing config. Local Android Studio / IntelliJ builds automatically allow
   unsigned Release packaging so IDE `Build APK` / `assemble` flows keep
   working. CLI and CI builds still require a usable keystore by default.
   GitHub PR builds automatically produce an unsigned Release for packaging
   validation. Other CI/PR environments can pass `-PallowUnsignedRelease=true`.

2. Build the default Release APK:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
   ```

3. Build multi-ABI Release APKs:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :app:assembleRelease -PbuildAllReleaseAbis=true
   ```

4. Artifacts are generated in `app/build/outputs/apk/release/`:
   ```text
   NeriPlayer-<git_short_hash>.<MMddHHmm>[-abi].apk
   ```

Security reminders:

- Never commit keystores, passwords, cookies, tokens, or other sensitive data.
- Do not paste full authorization data in Issues or PRs.
- Full config export files contain platform auth and sync credentials. Do not
  attach them publicly.

### Project Layout

#### Root modules

- `:app`
  - Main Android application.
- `:ksp-annotations` / `:ksp-processor`
  - KSP-generated settings schema, keys, backup allowlists, and UI metadata.
- `:accompanist-lyrics-core` / `:accompanist-lyrics-ui`
  - Lyrics parsing and Compose lyrics UI submodules.
- `build-logic`
  - Android/Kotlin/Compose convention plugins.
- `buildSrc`
  - Retained auxiliary Gradle build logic.
- `np-submodule/NeriPlayer-LTW`
  - Listen Together Cloudflare Workers server.
- `np-submodule/miuix`
  - Vendored upstream Miuix source/docs tree, not part of the current app module graph.

#### Android client key paths

- `app/src/main/java/moe/ouom/neriplayer/NeriPlayerApplication.kt`
  - Application initialization. Handles language, crash handling, `AppContainer`,
    Lyricon, global downloads, and the shared image loader.

- `app/src/main/java/moe/ouom/neriplayer/activity/`
  - `MainActivity.kt`: the only external entry point. Handles safe mode, startup, disclaimer,
    onboarding, external audio imports, Listen Together deep links, and the top-level
    Compose host.
  - Platform login activities live under `activity/auth/` and run in dedicated
    secondary processes. `activity/sync/` stores Activity-side sync warning state.
  - `NeteaseWebLoginActivity.kt`, `NeteaseQrLoginActivity.kt`,
    `BiliWebLoginActivity.kt`, `BiliQrLoginActivity.kt`, and `YouTubeWebLoginActivity.kt`:
    internal platform sign-in pages.

- `app/src/main/java/moe/ouom/neriplayer/ui/NeriApp.kt`
  - Top-level Compose app shell. Handles `NavHost`, dynamic bottom bar, `MiniPlayer`,
    `Now Playing` overlay, Debug routes, themes, cache cleanup, and playback service sync.
  - `MainTabLayerHost.kt` retains outgoing and incoming main-tab scenes,
    performs interruptible directional transitions, and preserves saveable state
    plus a glass owner for each scene.

- `app/src/main/java/moe/ouom/neriplayer/ui/component/lyrics/`
  - `AdvancedLyricsView.kt` and `SyncedLyricsView.kt`: advanced lyric layout,
    word/character highlighting, translation/phonetic display, click-to-seek,
    and long-press callbacks.
  - `LyricShareSheet.kt`: lyric-line selection, copy, song sharing, and lyric card generation.
  - The old `AppleMusicLyric` name exists only as an `@Deprecated` wrapper in
    `ui/component/LyricsCompatibility.kt`. New code should use `SyncedLyricsView`.

- `app/src/main/java/moe/ouom/neriplayer/ui/component/playback/`
  - `NeriMiniPlayer.kt`: bottom Mini Player, play/pause, and horizontal swipe for previous/next.
    Playback sound and sleep-timer sheets also live here.
  - Same-named files in the `ui/component/` root are primarily legacy package
    compatibility entry points. New implementations belong in responsibility-based
    subpackages such as `lyrics/`, `playback/`, `download/`, and `navigation/`.

- `app/src/main/java/moe/ouom/neriplayer/ui/screen/tab/`
  - `LibraryScreen.kt`: top-level Library categories. Local content can switch
    between playlists and artists, and Favorites can show playlists and followed artists.
  - `LocalArtistLibraryGrid.kt`: local artist grid, empty state, and artist cards.

- `app/src/main/java/moe/ouom/neriplayer/ui/screen/playlist/`
  - `LocalArtistDetailScreen.kt`: local artist details with play-all,
    multi-select, playlist export, and batch download for resolvable online songs.

- `app/src/main/java/moe/ouom/neriplayer/ui/screen/artist/`
  - NetEase artist detail screens for artist info, hot songs, paged albums,
    and follow state.

- `app/src/main/java/moe/ouom/neriplayer/ui/viewmodel/artist/`
  - NetEase artist summaries, JSON parsing, and detail-screen state management.

  - First-run onboarding for language, platform accounts, GitHub sync, and personalization.

- `app/src/main/java/moe/ouom/neriplayer/core/api/`
  - `netease/`: NetEase endpoints, crypto, and account capabilities.
  - `bili/`: Bilibili search, QR login, favorites, collections, playback info,
    and audio stream extraction.
  - `youtube/`: YouTube Music client based on NewPipe Extractor, home/playlist/search/playback,
    PoToken, and JS Challenge support.
  - `search/`: playback metadata/lyrics completion APIs. Current implementations:
    `CloudMusicSearchApi` and `QQMusicSearchApi`.
  - `lyrics/`: external lyrics sources. Current implementation: `LrcLibClient`.

- `app/src/main/java/moe/ouom/neriplayer/core/player/`
  - `PlayerManager.kt`: unified Media3 ExoPlayer management, stream resolution, queue,
    cache, state recovery, retry, and playback policy.
  - `service/AudioPlayerService.kt`: foreground playback service, media notification,
    MediaSession, and media button handling.
  - `download/AudioDownloadManager.kt`: resolves platform streams and saves downloads;
    `DownloadParallelism.kt` defines concurrency boundaries.
  - `effects/PlaybackEffectsController.kt`: speed, pitch, loudness enhancer, and equalizer.
  - `engine/`: Media3 audio processors, including loudness normalization,
    channel balance, and high-resolution output processing.
  - `playback/PlaybackStatsTracker.kt`: playback stats tracking. Playback commands
    and queue advancement live in `playback/PlayerManagerPlaybackExtensions.kt`.
  - `timer/SleepTimerManager.kt`: sleep timer.
  - `engine/datasource/ConditionalHttpDataSourceFactory.kt`: adds platform-specific request headers.
  - `watchdog/PlayerManagerStartupWatchdogExtensions.kt` and
    `lifecycle/PlayerManagerLifecycleExtensions.kt`:
    playback startup watchdogs, foreground/background health audits, failure recovery,
    and USB-exclusive fallback handling.
  - `resolver/netease/PlayerManagerNeteaseAutoSourceSwitch.kt`: Bilibili fallback for NetEase
    tracks that are restricted, have no playable URL, or only return previews.
  - `resolver/youtube/YouTubeGoogleVideoRangeSupport.kt`, `YouTubeSeekRefreshPolicy.kt`, and
    `prefetch/YouTubePrefetchRunner.kt`: YouTube Music playback compatibility policies.
  - `metadata/`: lyrics, metadata, and external Bluetooth lyrics handling.
  - `model/`: player-specific state models. Cross-layer song models do not live here.
  - `usb/`: split into `device/`, `path/`, `session/`, `sink/`, `system/`, and
    `transport/` for USB-exclusive sessions, the native bridge, runtime snapshots,
    and recovery controls. The current implementation covers **UAC1.0** and
    compatible **UAC2.0 Type I PCM** devices, with 32-bit PCM, software
    PCM-float conversion, UAC2 explicit feedback, coordinated AudioSink
    reconfiguration, dynamic transfer scaling, and backpressure stall recovery.

- `app/src/main/java/moe/ouom/neriplayer/core/download/`
  - `GlobalDownloadManager.kt`: global download tasks and downloaded song list.
  - `ManagedDownloadStorage.kt` is the facade for app-managed and SAF storage.
    Implementation details are split across `storage/commit/`, `delete/`, `lookup/`,
    `migration/`, `recovery/`, `snapshot/`, `tree/`, and `working/`.
  - `task/DownloadTaskStore.kt`: persisted download tasks, status, progress, and attempt IDs.
  - `policy/DownloadLifecyclePolicies.kt`: recovery, cancellation cleanup, and fast-settle policies.
  - `naming/ManagedDownloadNaming.kt`: filename templates and legacy filename compatibility.
  - `metadata/DownloadedAudioTagWriter.kt`: audio tag writing; `catalog/` owns
    downloaded-song catalog models.

- `app/src/main/java/moe/ouom/neriplayer/core/startup/`
  - Startup stages and decisions are split across `app/`, `crash/`, `download/`,
    `logging/`, `permission/`, `player/`, `safemode/`, `sync/`, and `theme/`.
    `MainActivity` coordinates these components with the UI lifecycle.

- `app/src/main/java/moe/ouom/neriplayer/data/`
  - `model/`: shared `SongItem`, `SongIdentity`, and media model extensions used
    by playback, playlists, downloads, sync, Listen Together, and UI.
  - `settings/`: `DataStore` settings, KSP schema, bootstrap snapshot, theme snapshot,
    and playback preference snapshot.
  - `auth/`: NetEase, Bilibili, and YouTube cookie/auth storage and validation.
  - `platform/netease/`: NetEase platform-side caches, currently including playlist detail cache.
  - `storage/`: storage usage analysis, cache grouping, and extra cache cleanup.
  - `local/playlist/`: local playlist JSON atomic writes, system playlist compatibility,
    background metadata hydration, and local artist aggregation models.
  - `local/audioimport/`, `local/media/`: local audio import, fast scans,
    background metadata hydration, cover fallback resolution, and sharing.
  - `playlist/favorite/`, `playlist/usage/`: favorite playlists, followed artists,
    and Home continue-listening data.
  - `history/`, `stats/`: recent plays, playback stats, and day/week/month/year/all-time aggregation.
  - `backup/`: playlist JSON backup/import and diff analysis.

  - `sync/model/`: payload and conflict models shared by GitHub and WebDAV.
  - `sync/`: provider-neutral coordination, preferences, and cover mapping.
  - `sync/github/`: GitHub transport, three-way merge, serialization, Data Saver,
    and secure storage.
  - `sync/webdav/`: WebDAV sync, remote config, Worker, and WebDAV API.

- `app/src/main/java/moe/ouom/neriplayer/listentogether/`
  - `protocol/` defines room, event, and transport models; `network/` owns
    HTTP/WebSocket and reconnect behavior; `playback/` owns queues, authoritative
    stream links, and position sync. `control/`, `session/`, `invite/`, `mapping/`,
    and `validation/` own their corresponding policies and boundaries.
  - The root retains `ListenTogetherSessionManager.kt` and a few compatibility
    entry points. New protocol logic should not keep accumulating in the root package.

- `app/src/main/cpp/`
  - Native crash handling lives under `crash/`. USB code is split across
    `usb/exclusive/`, `usb/feedback/`, `usb/iso/`, `usb/pcm/`, `usb/uac1/`,
    and `usb/uac2/`, with matching host tests under `tests/usb/`.

- `app/src/main/java/moe/ouom/neriplayer/core/lyricon/`
  - Lyricon integration and SuperLyric output for current song, playback state, position,
    word-level lyrics, and translations.

### Current Boundaries

- `Explore` is NetEase curated playlists + YouTube Music playlists +
  platform-specific NetEase/Bilibili/YouTube Music search. It is not mixed search.
- `Home` mainly shows local continue-listening and NetEase recommendations in the
  default Chinese mode. International mode prioritizes YouTube Music home shelves.
- The QQ Music entry in `Library` is still a placeholder and does not represent
  full platform integration.
- Local artist categories are aggregated from imported/saved local songs by
  display artist. They are not an online artist directory.
- NetEase artist detail pages depend on NetEase artist metadata and endpoints;
  follow state is saved into the local Favorites category.
- `Bilibili` supports search, favorites, audio playback, and downloads, but is
  not a full video discovery or comments client.
- `YouTube Music` supports login, anonymous playback, home/playlist browsing,
  details, search, playback, and downloads. Valid identity cookies are preserved
  and rotated when needed; bootstrap, `player.js`, PoToken, and challenge-result
  caches are reused; signature or direct-link failures can fall through to EJS/HLS.
  Cache hits and local tests are not proof of real-account or network stability.
  Large seeks in long audio use an expedited startup-recovery window and still
  need real-network qualification.
- Status-bar lyrics depend on private vendor support and only work on select devices.
- The RuntimeShader fluid/audio-reactive background is enabled only on Android 13+.
  Cover blur and advanced blur require Android 12+, so animation changes must
  preserve the fallback path for older versions.
- Phonetic lyric display depends on phonetic lyrics returned by the platform or
  phonetic fields embedded in word-level lyrics. When no phonetic data exists,
  do not synthesize it or render an empty second line.
- Lyric sharing uses `FileProvider` to share lyric card files from the app cache.
  These generated share files are cleanable cache, not user-downloaded content.
- Lyricon/SuperLyric position updates use an independent 200 ms feed anchored to
  elapsed realtime. Changes to playback progress intervals must preserve foreground
  and background lyric timing.
- NetEase playback tries lower qualities when the current quality is unavailable.
  For restricted, missing-URL, or preview-only tracks, it can auto-match a
  Bilibili or local-audio fallback source when enabled.
- NetEase playlist detail cache is only for playlist detail fast display and
  failure fallback. Album details still refresh live and should not reuse playlist cache.
- Local "My Favorite Music" can sync recognizable NetEase songs to NetEase
  Liked Songs. This requires NetEase login and skips unsupported or existing songs.
- Downloads use a shared `OkHttpClient` and write to the app directory or a SAF
  directory. They are **not** handled by the system `DownloadManager`, but they
  do support automatic resume and startup recovery.
- Download queues, cancellation records, and attempt IDs all participate in
  recovery decisions. When changing recovery, make sure stale requests cannot
  clear task state for newer requests.
- Resume behavior depends on transport type:
  - direct downloads resume through working-file size plus `Range`
  - `googlevideo` explicit chunked downloads resume by byte offset
  - HLS downloads resume from a saved segment checkpoint in `.hls.json`
- Working files live under `cache/download_staging/` and also keep `.resume.json`
  metadata so unfinished downloads can be reconstructed after app restart or
  network recovery.
- Manual cancellation rolls back partial artifacts and removes working files.
  Partial data is preserved only for network-policy pauses and recoverable retry paths.
- When the audio body is complete, tag-writing or an unwritable SAF handle still
  finalizes the download without tags; the completed audio must not be deleted.
- The app-private download directory is usually faster than custom SAF directories.
  SAF snapshots and indexes reduce directory walking, and an empty scan must not
  overwrite an existing index. SAF access should not be treated as having the same
  cost as normal file IO.
- Local audio sharing exposes a controlled URI directly when possible; content URIs
  that cannot be shared directly are copied to cache staging, which is cleanable.
- Storage cleanup must only delete regenerable cache, download staging, and share
  staging. Do not delete user-saved audio, downloaded lyrics/covers, or auth data
  through normal cache cleanup.
- Streaming cache and permanent downloads are separate features: cache uses
  `SimpleCache`; downloads are written by `AudioDownloadManager` and
  `ManagedDownloadStorage`.
- GitHub / WebDAV sync only sync metadata. Audio caches, downloaded files, local
  media files, cookies, and playback tokens are not synced.
- Local and synced playlists use `songOrderVersion` to distinguish order semantics:
  `0` is the legacy order and `1` is the current display order. Older data must
  be migrated compatibly instead of being interpreted directly as the new order.
- Sync snapshots may come from older JSON/ProtoBuf payloads or malformed remote
  files. Use safe defaults, filter records without resolvable track identity,
  valid deletion time, or valid playlist id, and never let songs with missing
  `addedAt` sort ahead of songs that already have timestamps.
- Data Saver writes raw `GZIP(ProtoBuf)` bytes to `backup-raw.bin`; normal mode writes
  `backup.json`. Reads must also accept historical `backup.bin` Base64. Do not switch
  formats on one client before Android and Desktop both support read-both. JSON, compressed,
  and decompressed payloads are capped at 8 MiB, 12 MiB, and 16 MiB.
- GitHub sync writes through Git Data API blob/tree/commit calls and advances the branch
  with a non-force ref update. Base64 in blob requests is only the API transport envelope;
  raw content reads and repository bodies remain binary. Do not reintroduce the deprecated
  asset-manifest transport.
- WebDAV prefers ETag/Last-Modified conditional writes. Without condition tokens,
  only an unchanged remote SHA-256 fingerprint permits an unconditional retry;
  otherwise return a concurrency conflict.
- Playback and traffic statistics use delayed batch writes. Playback stats flush at
  important player/activity lifecycle points, while traffic accumulators flush when
  a request or download attempt ends; playback daily buckets are bounded by retention
  window and count.
- Platform cookies/auth data, GitHub tokens, and WebDAV passwords are encrypted
  with `Android Keystore + EncryptedSharedPreferences`.
- `DataStore` stores regular settings and non-sensitive state, not platform login credentials.
- Long-form progress memory applies only to tracks at least 15 minutes long. Positions
  below 5 seconds are ignored, positions within 30 seconds of the end are cleared,
  explicit playback positions win, and the persisted field is `resumePositionMs`.
  This is not third-party playback history.
- BilibiliSponsorBlock is disabled by default. It sends only a SHA-256 prefix of the
  current BV ID and performs skips locally; it stays disabled during Listen Together,
  and its public results must not enter sync or room state.
- 32-bit high-resolution system output preserves the high-precision pipeline on
  regular Android system output and bypasses loudness normalization, channel
  balance, audio visualization, and in-app speed processing. Check settings copy
  and tests together when changing it.
- USB exclusive playback depends on a compatible **UAC1.0** or
  **UAC2.0 Type I PCM** DAC, the foreground service, wake locks, and the system
  background policy. The in-app background-permission prompt is not decorative,
  so screen-off behavior must stay in scope.
- USB settings include bit-perfect volume mode: software gain remains at 0 dB and
  the DAC hardware controls volume. Do not treat it as ordinary app/system volume.
- If a foreground/background USB runtime report returns `native_refresh_deferred`,
  the player retries it only within a bounded budget; other invalid reports remain
  fail-closed.
- Local scan results may return quick metadata first and then hydrate richer
  title/artist/album/cover data in the background. Do not assume the first scan
  result is the final local metadata shape.
- When `shareAudioLinks=false` in Listen Together, room snapshots and queue items
  must not expose `streamUrl`. Turning the setting off must also clear any cached
  shared links immediately, and `REQUEST_LINK` must be rejected.
- Listen Together repeat/shuffle changes use `PLAYBACK_MODE` /
  `REQUEST_PLAYBACK_MODE`. Member controls must validate the target stable track
  key, reject older `clientInstanceId`/`clientSequence`/`clientTimeMs` events, and
  limit `REQUEST_SET_TRACK` to the current queue.
- The current Listen Together track keeps at most three deduplicated HTTP(S) candidates.
  Listeners resolve their own quality policy first; candidates are only a session-scoped
  fallback and must never be written to normal song or offline caches. Server position is
  projected from track duration, with single-track repeat wrapping by duration; rejoining
  with the same member credential must not trigger new-member auto-pause.

### Extension Paths

#### 1. Add an Explore search source

Use this when integrating a new platform into `Explore` search or discovery.

1. Implement a client or repository under `core/api/`.
2. Add request, pagination, and state mapping in `ExploreViewModel`.
3. Add platform tabs and result UI in `ExploreScreen` / host screens.
4. If playback is needed, connect the platform to `PlayerManager` stream resolution.
5. If downloads are needed, complete `AudioDownloadManager` and download metadata mapping.

#### 2. Add a playback metadata completion source

Use this for cover, lyrics, and track metadata completion, not for `Explore`.

1. Implement a new `SearchApi` under `core/api/search/`.
2. Register the singleton in `AppContainer`.
3. Add routing, matching, and fallback logic in `SearchManager`.
4. Add `MusicPlatform`, string resources, and debug probes as needed.

#### 3. Add a streaming platform

1. Use `bili/` or `youtube/` as a reference for client and playback repository design.
2. Extend `core/player/engine/datasource/ConditionalHttpDataSourceFactory.kt`
   if special headers are needed.
3. Add the platform under `core/player/url/` and its matching `resolver/` path.
4. Keep downloads, lyrics, covers, and stats separated from transient streaming cache.
5. If NetEase Liked Songs sync should support the new source, provide stable
   NetEase song IDs or a verified mapping and reuse candidate validation in
   `LocalPlaylistRepository`.

#### 4. Modify NetEase auto source switching

1. The entry point is the NetEase URL resolution flow in
   `core/player/url/PlayerManagerUrlExtensions.kt`.
2. Matching and scoring live in
   `core/player/resolver/netease/PlayerManagerNeteaseAutoSourceSwitch.kt`.
3. Auto source switching is only a fallback for restricted, missing-URL, or
   preview-only NetEase playback. Do not turn it into cross-platform aggregate search.
4. When changing matching, consider title, artist, video pages, duration
   tolerance, and cache key stability.

#### 5. Add a setting

1. Prefer registering keys, defaults, types, and UI metadata in
   `data/settings/AutoSettingsSchema.kt`.
2. Simple switches can use the generated `AutoSettingsRepository` and `AutoSettingsSwitchItems`.
3. Settings with side effects, mutual exclusion, permissions, or startup snapshot
   requirements should keep a handwritten setter.
4. If a setting affects early startup behavior, update the corresponding snapshot:
   `BootstrapSettingsSnapshot`, `ThemePreferenceSnapshot`, or `PlaybackPreferenceSnapshot`.
5. UI usually belongs in the matching `SettingsPage` in `SettingsScreen.kt` or
   under `ui/screen/tab/settings/component/`.

#### 6. Modify USB exclusive playback

1. Read `core/player/usb/sink/UsbExclusiveAudioSink.kt`,
   `core/player/usb/transport/`, `core/player/usb/session/`,
   `core/player/policy/usb/UsbAudioSinkReconfigurationCoordinator.kt`,
   `core/player/watchdog/PlayerManagerStartupWatchdogExtensions.kt`,
   `core/player/lifecycle/PlayerManagerLifecycleExtensions.kt`, and related tests first.
2. The current USB-exclusive implementation supports **UAC1.0** and compatible
   **UAC2.0 Type I PCM** devices. If support expands to more complex UAC2.0
   topologies or non-Type-I PCM devices, update the docs, boundaries,
   diagnostics, and compatibility assumptions together.
3. Consider device selection, sample-rate/bit-depth policies, 32-bit PCM,
   software PCM-float conversion, UAC2 clock topology, explicit-feedback
   endpoints, foreground/background buffers, wake locks, background-permission
   prompts, and the system-fallback path together. Implicit feedback is not a
   supported candidate yet.
4. When changing automatic recovery, keep-alive logic, or background audits,
   validate foreground playback, screen-off background playback, USB attach/detach,
   and Android system fallback paths.
5. When changing feedback clocks, long-gap reacquisition, coordinated
   reconfiguration, dynamic transfer scaling, backpressure recovery, or candidate
   bit-depth fallback, also check
   `UsbExclusiveOutputFormatResolverTest`, `UsbExclusivePcmWritePlannerTest`,
   `UsbExclusiveSessionControllerReusePolicyTest`,
   `UsbAudioSinkReconfigurationCoordinatorTest`, and native USB feedback/PCM/UAC tests.
6. Runtime Report v2 parsing must remain fail-closed. When changing feedback
   endpoint, state, holdover, recovery-action, or generation fields, update the
   Kotlin parser and boundary tests together.
7. If error semantics or recovery behavior changes, update the Settings / Debug
   diagnostics surfaces and the matching tests.
8. Native changes should run all three host gates plus the four-ABI Android
   compile. Host models, ABI compilation, and real-DAC validation are separate gates.

#### 7. Modify GitHub / WebDAV sync

1. Understand `data/sync/model/SyncDataModels.kt` and
   `data/sync/github/SyncDataSerializer.kt` compatibility first. Shared payload
   models must not move back into the GitHub provider package.
2. Sync data includes playlists, favorite playlists, recent plays, deletion records,
   and playback stats. Data Saver writes raw `GZIP(ProtoBuf)` to `backup-raw.bin`,
   normal mode writes `backup.json`, and the reader must also accept historical
   `backup.bin` Base64. GitHub Git Data API blob requests use Base64 only as a
   transport envelope; the repository body remains raw binary.
3. `songOrderVersion=0` represents legacy order, while `songOrderVersion=1`
   represents current display order. Serialization, merging, and local restoration
   must preserve the migration path for older data.
4. Playlist membership uses `syncMembershipTokens` / `removedMembershipTokens`
   for observed-remove semantics. New fields must remain readable when legacy JSON
   or ProtoBuf payloads omit them; tokenized membership must not fall back to a
   timestamp-only deletion decision.
5. Missing-field or malformed snapshots must be cleaned before merging. `SyncSong`
   needs at least one of id, audioId, or mediaUri; deletion records also need a
   valid deletion time; songs with missing `addedAt` are low-priority display items.
6. `CoverUrlMapper.kt` lives in provider-neutral `data/sync/`. Most merge logic
   lives in `GitHubSyncManager.kt`; WebDAV reuses the same data model and much of
   the merge behavior.
7. Do not break the delayed sync, periodic sync, validated-network checks, or retry
   behavior in `GitHubSyncWorker.kt` / `WebDavSyncWorker.kt`. GitHub writes must use
   the remote branch head and a non-force update, failing on conflicts rather than
   overwriting. Large-file reads should use the raw content path, and WebDAV writes
   without ETag/Last-Modified must revalidate the remote fingerprint before an
   unconditional retry.
8. Sensitive data must go through `SecureTokenStorage.kt` or `WebDavStorage.kt`.
   Do not store it in `DataStore` or plaintext JSON.

#### 8. Modify download storage

1. Read `ManagedDownloadStorage.kt`, `naming/ManagedDownloadNaming.kt`,
   `task/DownloadTaskStore.kt`, `policy/DownloadLifecyclePolicies.kt`, and related
   unit tests first.
2. Consider app-managed storage, SAF custom directories, migration, legacy names,
   metadata files, and `.nomedia`.
3. Download tasks write to `cache/download_staging/` before being committed to
   the final directory. `.resume.json` and `.hls.json` are part of resume
   recovery and should not be treated as disposable temp files.
4. Default download concurrency is **6**, configurable from **1-8**.
   When changing concurrency, retry, or network recovery, check
   `DownloadParallelism.kt`, `AudioDownloadManager.kt`, and `GlobalDownloadManager.kt`.
5. Changes to migration, delete semantics, resume checkpoints, or sidecar writes
   must update or add unit tests.

#### 9. Modify lyrics display, sharing, or phonetics

1. Now Playing lyrics mainly live in `ui/component/lyrics/AdvancedLyricsView.kt`,
   `ui/component/lyrics/SyncedLyricsView.kt`, and `NowPlayingScreen.kt`.
2. The full-screen Lyrics page lives in `LyricsScreen.kt`, and lyric sharing reuses
   `LyricShareSheet.kt`.
3. Phonetic display is controlled by the `lyric_translation_use_phonetic` setting,
   requires lyric translation to be enabled, and only works when the current lyrics
   include phonetic data.
4. Long-press opens the lyric sharing sheet. When changing gestures, also check
   click-to-seek, manual lyric offset, and advanced lyric viewport scrolling.
5. Lyric cards are shared through `FileProvider` cache files. If the output location
   changes, update `file_paths.xml` and cache cleanup behavior as well.

#### 10. Modify storage usage and cache cleanup

1. Entry points are `data/storage/StorageUsageAnalyzer.kt` and
   `SettingsStorageCacheSection.kt`.
2. When adding a cache directory, decide whether it belongs to cleanable cache,
   downloaded content, diagnostics, or app data.
3. Cleanup actions must target regenerable content only. Downloaded songs,
   downloaded lyrics, download indexes, and auth data must not be removed by
   normal cache cleanup.
4. When clearing download staging, respect current download task state. Staging
   files for active tasks should wait until the task ends.

#### 11. Modify NetEase playlist detail cache

1. The cache entry point is `NeteasePlaylistCacheRepository.kt`; page state is in
   `NeteaseCollectionDetailViewModel.kt`.
2. The cache signature is based on track count and recent track IDs, mainly to
   decide whether the track list can be reused.
3. Network or parse failures may fall back to cache, but manual refresh should keep
   force-refresh semantics.
4. Album details do not use this playlist cache, so keep the data models separated.

#### 12. Modify Lyricon integration

1. The integration entry point is `core/lyricon/LyriconManager.kt`.
2. The setting key is `lyricon_enabled`, and playback lifecycle keeps it in sync.
3. Lyrics use `LyricEntry`; word-level data comes from `WordTiming`, and
   translations are matched to original lines by timestamp tolerance.
4. Lyricon/SuperLyric position updates use an independent 200 ms feed anchored to
   elapsed realtime; preserve foreground/background timing when changing progress.
5. Keep Lyricon, SuperLyric, status-bar lyrics, advanced Now Playing lyrics,
   and external Bluetooth lyrics compatible when changing lyric structures.

#### 13. Modify Listen Together

1. Android client logic is under `listentogether/`.
2. Server logic is under `np-submodule/NeriPlayer-LTW`.
3. Protocol field changes must stay compatible across the Android client and Worker,
   and tests must be updated.
4. When `shareAudioLinks=false`, HTTP and WebSocket room snapshots must not expose
   `track.streamUrl` or `queue[*].streamUrl`, and turning the setting off must
   clear any cached shared links immediately.
5. `REQUEST_LINK` / `LINK_READY`, member control, controller-offline recovery,
   and version-gated updates must be reviewed together so older state cannot
   overwrite newer room state.
6. Repeat/shuffle mode uses `PLAYBACK_MODE` / `REQUEST_PLAYBACK_MODE`. Member
   requests and `LINK_READY` must validate the target stable track key so async
   results cannot land on the wrong track.
7. First joins require `joinSecret`; member reconnects require `memberSecret`.
   Never persist either secret in sanitized room state or logs, and treat invite URI
   `secret` values as sensitive input.
8. Control events may carry `clientInstanceId`, `clientSequence`, and `clientTimeMs`.
   The Worker filters stale order, and `REQUEST_SET_TRACK` can only select an item
   already in the current queue. Keep the Android compatibility path aligned.
9. Explicit member departure uses `/api/rooms/:roomId/leave`; the Worker removes
   the member and broadcasts `MEMBER_LEFT`. A normal WebSocket close is transport
   churn and must preserve the credential-bound member for reconnects; an explicit
   controller departure closes the room.
10. Treat the 6-character room ID, 1-24 character nickname, queue limit 2000,
   and request de-duplication as protocol boundaries, not just UI validation details.
11. Settings support custom server URLs and availability tests. Do not hard-code a single server.

#### 14. Modify main navigation and glass transitions

1. The production main-tab path is shared by `NeriApp.kt` and
   `MainTabLayerHost.kt`; tab order and direction come from
   `resolveMainTabTransitionDirection`.
2. Keep both outgoing and incoming scenes alive during transitions and preserve
   per-tab state with `SaveableStateHolder`. Rapid reverse or repeated requests
   must not clear the old scene before settlement.
3. Each scene owns a separate `MainTabGlassOwner`. Advanced Glass changes must
   keep only visible owners in composition while detail-page handoff remains
   owned by the navigation layer.
4. `coherent_feedback_enabled` defaults to off. Detail pages use a drawer-style
   foreground rise over a slightly recessed background until coherent feedback
   is explicitly enabled.
5. Cover forward, reverse, interrupted, repeated-request, state-restoration, and
   startup-first-frame behavior. Geometry tests must not treat an unlaid-out
   `Rect(0, 0, 0, 0)` scene as a real overlap.
6. At minimum, check `NeriAppMainTabTransitionPolicyTest`,
   `AdvancedGlassNavigationTransitionTest`, `NeriAppNavigationTransitionTest`,
   and `HostNavigationTransitionGeometryTest`.

### Debugging & Logs

- Enable Developer Mode by tapping the **version number** 7 times in Settings.
- A standalone `Debug` tab appears after enabling it.
- Regular file logging is enabled only in Developer Mode.
- Crash logs are written independently by `ExceptionHandler` / `NativeCrashHandler`.
- The Debug tab contains YouTube, Bili, NetEase, Search, and Listen Together probes,
  plus regular log and crash log viewers.

Common command:

```bash
adb logcat | findstr NeriPlayer
```

Linux / macOS:

```bash
adb logcat | grep NeriPlayer
```

### Testing & PR

Before submitting, consider at least these checks:

1. Debug build:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
   ```
2. Unit tests:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
   ```
3. If you changed auth-dependent flows, stream resolution, or other integration-heavy
   behavior, optional smoke tests are available:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest -DrunNeteaseSmoke=true
   ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest \
     -DrunYouTubePlaybackSmoke=true \
     -DyoutubeSmokeVideoId=<id> \
     [-DyoutubeSmokeForceRefresh=true] \
     [-DyoutubeSmokeCookieFile=/absolute/path/to/cookies.json]
   ```
4. If you changed resources, UI, navigation, settings, sync, or storage logic:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :app:lintDebug
   ```
5. If you changed Compose UI, permissions, Activity, or login flows:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest
   ```
6. If you changed native USB code, match the dedicated Android Native CI gates:
   ```bash
   for profile in release-werror-asserts asan-ubsan tsan; do
     tools_pub/usb-async-lab host-test \
       --manifest app/src/main/cpp/tests/usb/config/run-manifest.example.yaml \
       --profile "$profile"
   done

   ./gradlew :app:externalNativeBuildDebug \
     --no-daemon \
     --warning-mode all \
     --stacktrace
   ```
   The host gate runs one fixed CTest inventory. The Android build must also
   produce non-empty `lib_neri.so` outputs for `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`,
   `x86`, and `x86_64`.
7. If you changed the Listen Together Worker:
   ```bash
   npm ci --prefix np-submodule/NeriPlayer-LTW
   npm run check --prefix np-submodule/NeriPlayer-LTW
   ```
   `npm run check` runs `node --check`, protocol tests, and
   `wrangler deploy --dry-run`. Protocol or room-state changes still need real
   create/join/WebSocket flow verification.
8. Add unit tests under `app/src/test/`.
   Add device or Compose UI tests under `app/src/androidTest/`.
9. If behavior changes affect README, settings copy, user flows, or sync formats,
   update documentation in the same PR.
